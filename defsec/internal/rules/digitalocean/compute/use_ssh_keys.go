		Summary:     "SSH Keys are the preferred way to connect to your droplet, no keys are supplied",
		Impact:      "Logging in with username and password is easier to compromise",
		Resolution:  "Use ssh keys for login",
		Explanation: `When working with a server, youâ€™ll likely spend most of your time in a terminal session connected to your server through SSH. A more secure alternative to password-based logins, SSH keys use encryption to provide a secure way of logging into your server and are recommended for all users.`,
